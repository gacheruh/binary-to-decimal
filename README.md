The conversion of binary code to decimal involves multiplying each digit of the binary number by its corresponding power of 2, and then adding up all the results to obtain the decimal equivalent.

Starting from the rightmost digit of the binary number, the powers of 2 start at 2^0, which equals 1, and increase by a factor of 2 for each successive position to the left. For example, the second position from the right is 2^1, which equals 2, the third position is 2^2, which equals 4, and so on.

To convert a binary number to decimal, multiply each digit of the binary number by its corresponding power of 2, starting from the rightmost digit, and add up all the results. For example, to convert the binary number 1010 to decimal:

1. Starting from the rightmost digit, the powers of 2 are: 2^0 = 1, 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, and 2^3 = 8.
2. Multiply each digit of the binary number by its corresponding power of 2:
  >The rightmost digit is 0, so 0 x 1 = 0.
  
  >The next digit to the left is 1, so 1 x 2 = 2.
  
  >The next digit to the left is 0, so 0 x 4 = 0.
  
  >The leftmost digit is 1, so 1 x 8 = 8.
  
3. Add up all the results: 0 + 2 + 0 + 8 = 10.

Therefore, the binary number 1010 is equal to the decimal number 10.
